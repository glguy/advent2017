[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2017 solutions

I post my solutions as I finish them once the leaderboard for the day fills up. After submitting my
answer for the day I will typically go back and add type signatures, comments, and improve the
structure of the code.

Please join Freenode's #haskell channel if you're interested in discussing Haskell solutions to the AoC problems.
We'll be talking about them most of December.
